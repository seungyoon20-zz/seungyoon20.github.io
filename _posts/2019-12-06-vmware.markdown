- Designed and implemented a `Python SDK` for a de-centralized machine learning platform of VMware. 
- Provided APIs that allow data scientists to connect to the platform, to build, run and retrieve machine learning jobs on the platform with `Python Shell` or `Jupyter Notebook`.
- Packaged the SDK that can easily be installed and imported, and provided tutorials and user documents for data scientists.
