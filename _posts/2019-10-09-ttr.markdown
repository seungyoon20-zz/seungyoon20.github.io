## Description 
This multidisciplinary (MA/CS/RBE) project aims to address concerns surrounding in-office laser surgeries in the throat. Currently, surgeons have difficulty determining when the laser procedure successfully targets harmful cells, but minimally damages healthy tissue. The team is conducting research on various laser-tissue interactions in order to build mathematical models and classify the tissue as healthy or unhealthy based on the estimation of tissue parameters. The fact that these parameters change over time will allow us to monitor the change in the tissue properties resulting from laser exposure, which will assist the surgeon to determine the stopping point of the laser procedure.
