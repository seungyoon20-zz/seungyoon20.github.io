This is a piece of `Splatoon2` fan art after `Nintendo` released the `Octo Expansion DLC`. I used the octopus girl as my ingame avatar and I really like her outfit and haircut! In her hand is my favorite weapon in the game ---- `Nova Blaster`! I hope I can continue having fun with all my friends in the game.
