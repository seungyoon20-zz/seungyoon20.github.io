### I Owe New England School of Fine Art $15
I went to New England School of Fine Art tonight, while I and my friend **both forgot to bring cash ðŸ˜‚**. We each owe $15 until we come back from spring break and go figure drawing again.

### The Drawing
The most challenging part that I find with this model is to find good relationship between his right arm and his chest: **his arm squeezed with his muscle on the chest**. The rotation of the body also makes the 2 arms slightly different in size and different in height, but not different enough to be well shown in the drawing.

### Failure in the Proportion
When I started drawing, I didn't design the proportion well, so I could fit his full body in the drawing. Next time I should think about the proportion carefully before I start drawing.
