## Cambridge Office, CASB Team
From May to August in 2019, I worked as a software engineer intern student at Symantec Cambridge office with the Enterprise Security Products team on [CloudSOC CASB][cloudsoc]. The product and the team are current a division of Broadcom Inc.

## Internship Project
•	Developed a proof-of-concept scalable backend of [CloudSOC CASB][cloudsoc] for `Microsoft Azure`, which logs and identifies critical user activities, such as unauthorized resource purchases, dangerous permission changes and risky files creations.

•	Architected backend worker with `Python3 Async IO` and developed web UI in `Angular 2`. 

•	Setup `Docker `images and `CloudFormation` template to automate deploying the worker containers on `AWS ECS` cluster.

•	Designed dashboards that well visualize all user activity history and risky files under `Microsoft Azure` cloud storage so that users can monitor their accounts effectively from CASB web UI.

## Enjoyed the Summer Time with My Team in Cambridge

This was my first time working with such professional and talentful engineers! Those people were really smart and professional with software engineer tools, as well as cloud security techniques. I really enjoyed working out problems and discuss about my project with them!

I joined scrumbs on 10:30 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and when it reached the end of the last sprint, I joined the scrumbs everyday to keep up with the pace of others.

I have 2 other intern friends: **Amy and Gis**. We worked on different projects, that I focused on the proof-of-concept of new features, while they two worked on internal tools and release, but we still had a lot of fun together during lunch time.

I also met 2 friends who had alot of fun together with me: **Kevin and Wester**. They went to same scrumb meetings with me and worked together with me on the `CASB` for `Microsoft Azure`. Kevin helped me built beautiful and interactive front-end, and Wester provided a basic scalable backend worker class that I built my backend from. They also invited me join their project at **Symantec Innovation Day**, to build a chatbot that can help users setup their CASB.
