This is a photo of me working on a in-class figure drawing practice. I really love figure drawing!

In 2020 C term, I started with drawing portraits with pencils, and after I became used to pencil drawing, I started with drawing models' bodies. I learned from this class about finding the proportion of the body, discovering the outline of the body shape, and drawing shadows. Then I moved to charcoal drawing on gray paper, which I never touched before. I can still apply the techniques from pencil drawing, but controlling the charcoal pencil and applying highlight to the drawing have become the new challenges to me.

Although techniques are really helpful, when I found charcoal drawing was very challenging, they are not dominant factors to a good piece of figure drawing. The most important essential of a great drawing is to have a careful observation of the model and find the beauty of her/his body. Observing the models before I started to draw can prevent me from giving a too general drawing, and can help me show the characteristics of the model in my arts.

Finally, I really appreciate the efforts of **Professor Reinhardt**, who showed me how to approach a figure drawing step by step, the models, who gave me awesome chances to observe beautiful human bodies of different genders, ages, poses, and the classmates, who had a wonderful time together!
